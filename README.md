# mlops

**End-to-end MLOps helps ML practitioners efficiently and responsibly manage, monitor, govern, and explain ML projects throughout the entire development lifecycle.**

Here's why:

* **Management:** MLOps helps streamline data management, code versioning, model artifact management, and orchestration of various pipeline steps.
* **Monitoring:** It enables continuous monitoring of model performance, data drift, concept drift, and system health in production.
* **Governance:** MLOps facilitates compliance, auditing, reproducibility, and accountability by tracking experiments, data lineage, and model versions.
* **Explainability:** By providing tools and processes for understanding model behavior and predictions (e.g., through feature importance, counterfactual explanations), it aids in debugging, building trust, and meeting regulatory requirements.
* **Entire Development Lifecycle:** It encompasses everything from data ingestion and preparation, model training and evaluation, deployment, to ongoing monitoring and retraining, creating a continuous feedback loop.

The other options are too narrow and only describe specific subsets of what end-to-end MLOps offers:
* "only perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping" refers to the initial development phase.
* "only monitor ML models" focuses solely on the post-deployment operational aspect.
* "only train and tune ML models" covers a specific phase of model building.
